COVID-19 Speech Agent is a speech agent that uses a Unity program to relay statistical information about the COVID-19 virus. It features Dr. Mario as your liasion to this information, simply talk to him and ask about the current statistics for another county, province(state), or country!

## Dependencies & Tools
- Unity 2019.4.9
- Google's Dialogflow

I also used assets from Google Images for the sprites, such as Dr. Mario.
You can find the code used for the Fulfillment logic in fulfillment.js.

## Usage
Double-click the play button to start it up, then press the record button to talk to Dr. Mario and ask your questions about COVID-19 statistics relating to the number of deaths, recovered, or currently sick people.
