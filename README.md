COVID-19 Speech Agent is a speech agent that uses a Unity program to relay statistical information about the COVID-19 virus. It features Dr. Mario as your liasion to this information, simply talk to him and ask about the current statistics for another county, province(state), or country! Created for my Natural User Interaction class in the spring semester of 2020.

## Dependencies & Tools
- Unity 2019.4.9
- Google's Dialogflow

I also used assets from Google Images for the sprites, such as Dr. Mario.
You can find the code used for the Fulfillment logic in fulfillment.js.

## Usage
Double-click the play button to start it up, then press the record button to talk to Dr. Mario and ask your questions about COVID-19 statistics relating to the number of deaths, recovered, or currently sick people.

## Acknowledgements
A tutorial for using Google Dialogflow in Unity was provided by my professor, Jaime Ruiz, as well as a lot of the code used in the Unity project.
